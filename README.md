# Python-Music-Player-GUI
This music player was created using GUI and tkinter in Python. This was a final project made by 5 students for Data Structures and Algorithm (DSA). This music player loads the user's mp3 file, allow the user to play the music and customize it using different buttons. This music player also allows the users to add, edit, shuffle and remove music.
